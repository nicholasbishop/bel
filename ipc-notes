Rethinking the IPC a bit, some notes:

The window process has its own event loop from Glfw. That event loop
needs to go in the main thread because OpenGL, but it looks like the
capnp event loop can go to a separate thread. Then a thread-safe queue
can provide non-blocking events from capnp to Glfw. What about the
other direction?

Scene: Window.addEventReceiver(self.event_receiver)
...
Window: self.event_receiver.send(resize_event)
